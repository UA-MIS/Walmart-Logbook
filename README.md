# Walmart-Logbook
This website is a logbook for security assets stored in the Walmart ecosystem. These assets are stored in a gated area and then in lockboxes within that area. These security assets can be checked in/out and each action is stored in the logbook. This website has barcode scanning functionality and has the ability to deal with Active Directory accounts as well. More documentation will be provided but this site was programmed with scalability on a global scale in mind for multiple different functioning teams in the Walmart ecosystem.
